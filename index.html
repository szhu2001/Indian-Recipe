  <h1>Absolutely Perfect Palak Paneer</h1>
  <p class="description">This Indian dish combines fresh spinach and ricotta in a creamy curry. Use paneer if you can find it! It is absolutely wonderful with basmati rice or naan (Indian flat bread). The key is in the spices, which you can find at an Indian grocery.</p>
